# Alchemy Code Final Projects - May 2020

Welcome to [Alchemy Code Lab](https://www.alchemycodelab.com)! 

These students are finishing our professional software development training. Following you will find their BackEnd Projects which harnesses the use of MongoDB, NodeJS and Express. These projects were built in a one week sprint, remotely. The first time Alchemy students have ever done so this way. 

Our emphasis on process, regular testing and immersive lab sessions allow our grads to understand how their coding works and why it does what it does. As the only engineering education in town that serves Portland and Portland only, combined with in-person training by experienced senior software developers, our grads are real contributors. We stay on top of the most used technologies and aim for our grads to evolve Portland's economy and community through the companies they go to work for. [Here is an overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVKZ4wzOLJn5OeIE-94riRoJGLpwLRG1SuBdGY7sedg/edit?usp=sharing) of their syllabus through our Career Track training.  

## Below is an overview of the apps presented and links to their sites and video of their presentations. Links to the LinkedIn profile each student is also included.

A code companion. Budding software developers often struggle with the learning process of code challenges. This learning platform combines resources, videos and documentation to help developers build a foundation. Users can not only practice from our library of code challenges, but they can also review past attempts at various problems. We invite you take the Alcherithm challenge; happy coding!

## Poetica-Technica On Twitter [@PoeticaTechnica](https://twitter.com/PoeticaTechnica) :: [Josh Ford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thisisjoshford/), & 

Tabula-Rasa is the back end of the Poegram front end site, it is  written by Nathan Martel, Dorje Kirsten and Erin. It uses the Poetry DB database to construct single line random poems from a chosen author or a completely random line. This line of poetry is then dropped onto an image that is randomly generated to create a Poegram.

While we engaged in a project of creating code that could present this experience to you, it was our sincere wish that we were also creating a tool for reflection, appreciation, contemplation, writing prompts, or even casual divination. This is what a poegram is. A tabula-rasa, so to speak, for you to experience, generate, and share with the world.
