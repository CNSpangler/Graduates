# Alchemy Code Lab FullStack App Descriptions & Graduate Profiles - September 2019

Welcome to [Alchemy Code Lab](https://www.alchemycodelab.com)! 

These students have just finished more than 800 hours of our professional software development training. They've learned how to harness the FullStack JavaScript capabilities using React and Redux on the Front End with ExpressJS and MongoDB on the Back End (plus a dose of Firebase for realtime communication).

Our emphasis on process, regular testing and immersive lab sessions allow our grads to understand how their coding works and why it does what it does. As the only engineering education in town that serves Portland and Portland only, combined with in-person training by experienced senior software developers, our grads are real contributors. We stay on top of the most used technologies and aim for our grads to evolve Portland's economy and community through the companies they go to work for. [Here is an overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVKZ4wzOLJn5OeIE-94riRoJGLpwLRG1SuBdGY7sedg/edit?usp=sharing) of their syllabus through our Career Track training.  

# <h2> Below is an overview of the apps presented and links to their deployed and github profiles. Links to the presenters' LinkedIn profile or personal portfolio site is also included:

Happy Trees is a guess a sketch style game. One player is given a word to draw while the other player attempts to guess what is being drawn. The guessing player can see a real-time image of the drawing and how long the word is. Gain points for having your drawing guessed and for guessing a drawing with minimal attempts. Be careful to watch how much time is left!

Sick of having to text all your friends to see who’s available for a cup of tea? A concert? A work session?

Look no further. Pindrop makes it easy to let your friends know who, when, where, and what time. It’s a social app that can cure the back and forth of details, share the address of where you’ll be, and make plans with your friends a walk in the park. Sign up, follow your friends, post a pin, or just take a look and choose what activity/what friend you want to plan your day around. Spin this instant meetup option into your calendar and see how easy it can be to hang with the people you care about.

Unwasted is an app designed to prevent food waste. At it’s core, it functions as a platform to connect users with a surplus of food with those in need. It allows registered users to create posts, then other users to browse listings, contact users with products they are interested in, review the user they have made contact with, and consult other reviews in order to make sure they feel comfortable meeting the poster. We plan to continue developing this application after graduating from Alchemy and look forward to a real world launch in the next several months. Our hope is that we can provide a platform which allows altruism to flourish, and helps prevent unnecessary hunger.
