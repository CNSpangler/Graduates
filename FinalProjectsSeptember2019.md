# Alchemy Code Lab FullStack App Descriptions & Graduate Profiles - September 2019

Welcome to [Alchemy Code Lab](https://www.alchemycodelab.com)! 

These students have just finished more than 800 hours of our professional software development training. They've learned how to harness the FullStack JavaScript capabilities using React and Redux on the Front End with ExpressJS and MongoDB on the Back End (plus a dose of Firebase for realtime communication).

Our emphasis on process, regular testing and immersive lab sessions allow our grads to understand how their coding works and why it does what it does. As the only engineering education in town that serves Portland and Portland only, combined with in-person training by experienced senior software developers, our grads are real contributors. We stay on top of the most used technologies and aim for our grads to evolve Portland's economy and community through the companies they go to work for. [Here is an overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVKZ4wzOLJn5OeIE-94riRoJGLpwLRG1SuBdGY7sedg/edit?usp=sharing) of their syllabus through our Career Track training.

Unwasted is an app designed to prevent food waste. At it’s core, it functions as a platform to connect users with a surplus of food with those in need. It allows registered users to create posts, then other users to browse listings, contact users with products they are interested in, review the user they have made contact with, and consult other reviews in order to make sure they feel comfortable meeting the poster. We plan to continue developing this application after graduating from Alchemy and look forward to a real world launch in the next several months. Our hope is that we can provide a platform which allows altruism to flourish, and helps prevent unnecessary hunger.

# <h2> Workür :: [Danny Hogan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danny-hogan/), [Noah Ingram Puckett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahingrampuckett/) & [Dirt Deodara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirtdeodara/)
  
Workür allows users to track their job search progress and history. As a user finds a job posting online, they are able to upload information regarding that post, as well as their resume and cover letter (if they apply or intend to). They can update their progress from interested in the job, phone interview, in person interview, and job offered. They can also add notes to keep track of whatever information they would like.
We aim to make it an easy way for people to keep track of their job hunt and resumes/cover letters regarding the jobs they are applying to.
