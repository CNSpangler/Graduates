# Alchemy Code Lab FullStack App Descriptions & Graduate Profiles

Welcome to Alchemy Code Lab! 

Our students have just finished more than 800 hours of tech career training learning how to harness the FullStack JavaScript capabilities using React and Redux on the Front End with ExpressJS and MongoDB on the Back End (plus a dose of Firebase for realtime communication).

Our emphasis on process, regular testing and immersive lab sessions allow our grads to understand how their coding works and why it does what it does. As the only engineering education in town that serves Portland and Portland only, combined with in-person training by experienced senior software developers, our grads are real contributors. We stay on top of the most used technologies and aim for our grads to evolve Portland's economy and community through the companies they go to work for. [Here is an overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVKZ4wzOLJn5OeIE-94riRoJGLpwLRG1SuBdGY7sedg/edit?usp=sharing) of their syllabus through our Career Track training.

Multnomah Legal Aid is a case management app designed for the local chapter of National Lawyers Guild, a non-profit that has provided pro-bono legal observing across the US since 1937. Using MongoDB with Mongoose, Express.js, React with Redux, and Node.js, this app will help the organization better import, organize, and manage data for the people they serve.

Bitfrost is a ridesharing app. Think Bifrost, Thor's magical rainbow bridge to Asgard + 'bit' as in a bit of information. The goal is to connect carpoolers. Riders pay on the app, and drivers offer their car for rides now and in the future. Building it using the MERN stack, we've already set up a CI/CD pipeline with Travis to Heroku. We're going to try to use a couple DBs (Firebase and Mongo), an auth API, Stripe or Paypal for payments, and a Google API for geolocation.
